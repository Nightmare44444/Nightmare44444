ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Avinash! With a background in electrical engineering and a deep interest in data science, machine learning, and deep learning, Iâ€™m dedicated to transforming data into actionable insights. Iâ€™ve completed a '100 Days of Machine Learning' challenge, which extended into a rewarding 132-day journey, solidifying my skills and fostering my passion for data analysis and modeling.

ðŸ”¬ My projects focus on building intuitive models and visualizations, with particular experience in using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and various ML libraries, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

ðŸŒ± I enjoy tackling challenges in classification, clustering, and recommendation systems, and Iâ€™m always keen to deepen my understanding of deep learning architectures and AI applications.

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on projects that turn data into decisions!
